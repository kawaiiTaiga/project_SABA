### The Problem

<img src="https://github.com/kawaiiTaiga/project_SABA/blob/main/images/llm_tools.PNG" alt="Current Interaction" width="1000">

LLMs can use digital tools (code interpreters, search engines, databases) via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
But connecting them to physical hardwareâ€”cameras, motors, sensorsâ€”is complicated.

---

### The Solution

<img src="https://github.com/kawaiiTaiga/project_SABA/blob/main/images/llm_peripherals.PNG" alt="SABA Interaction" width="1000">

SABA provides a simple way for LLMs to control physical devices.
Define your hardware's purpose in natural language, and the LLM figures out the rest.

---

### Why SABA?

**Plug & Play.** Configure Wi-Fi once, and your device is ready.
**No schemas.** Just describe what your device does in natural language.
**Intent-based.** Instead of "rotate motor 50Â°," you define "open_living_room_curtain."
**LLM-native.** Works seamlessly with Claude, GPT, and other LLMs via MCP.

## How It Works

#### 1. Hardware as Tools
Your devices become tools that LLMs can autonomously use during conversationsâ€”just like they use code interpreters or search engines.

#### 2. Simple Setup
Connect your device, configure Wi-Fi/MQTT once, and it's ready. The LLM can immediately understand and control it through SABA's core server.

#### 3. Semantic Function Design
A motor can do thousands of things. What matters is the intent:
- `water_plant` (not "activate pump for 3 seconds")
- `open_curtain` (not "rotate motor 90 degrees")
- `press_coffee_button` (not "extend actuator 2cm")

The LLM understands the purpose from the name. No complex configurations needed.

#### 4. Works with Any Hardware
From simple motors and sensors to cameras and complex actuators. ESP32-based for affordability, with plans to support more platforms.

## Current Status

**Version 0** A

**Version 0.1** - Proof of concept

What works:
- âœ… ESP32 device SDK with automatic provisioning
- âœ… MCP bridge server for Claude Desktop integration
- âœ… Camera, motor, sensor, and LED control examples
- âœ… Web-based projection manager

What's next:
- Security (TLS/encryption)
- Performance optimization
- Better documentation and tutorials
- Event-driven architecture for proactive agents
- More example projects
