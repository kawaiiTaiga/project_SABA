# MCP-BRIDGE

A lightweight MQTT â†” MCP Bridge for Project Saba. This gateway server connects LLMs with real-world sensors and actuators.

---

## Overview

MCP-BRIDGE acts as a translator between two worlds:

-   **MQTT Broker**: It communicates with IoT devices by collecting events and routing commands.
-   **MCP Server**: It exposes a standardized interface for LLMs (like Claude Desktop) to interact with the physical world.
-   **HTTP API**: It provides a FastAPI-based API for health checks, status monitoring, and serving assets.


## Core Features

- **Device Registry**: Collects announce/status messages to cache a list of available devices and their online status.
- **Command Routing**: Matches an LLM's tool call to an MQTT command and pairs the eventual response using a request_id.
- **Asset Proxy**: Proxies device-generated assets (e.g., camera images) over HTTP at `/assets/{request_id}`.
- **MCP Server**: Exposes standardized tools and resources for any MCP-compatible client.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ (or Docker)
- A running Mosquitto MQTT Broker (listening on port 1883)

### Running Locally

**Start the MQTT Broker (if you don't have one running):**

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 1883:1883 eclipse-mosquitto:2
```

**Start the Bridge Server:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python bridge_mcp.py
```

**Check Health Status:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

> Note: If port 8080 is in use, the bridge will automatically attempt to use the next available port (8081, 8082, etc.).

---

## API Endpoints

- `GET /healthz`: Returns the server's health status.
- `GET /devices`: Returns a list of all registered devices.
- `GET /devices/{device_id}`: Returns the details for a single device.
- `GET /assets/{request_id}`: Proxies the first (or only) asset from a device's response.
- `GET /assets/{request_id}/{index}`: Proxies an asset by its specific index.

## MCP Integration

An LLM can use the following tools and resources provided by this server.

### Tools
- `invoke(device_id, tool, args)`: A general-purpose invoker for any device tool.
- `capture_image(device_id, quality, flash)`: An example tool for capturing an image from a camera device.

### Resources
- `bridge://devices`: A list of all available devices.
- `bridge://device/<id>`: Detailed information about a specific device.
- `bridge://asset/<request_id>`: The result of an event, including any associated assets.

## Usage Scenario

1. An ESP32-CAM connects to the MQTT broker and publishes an announce message.  
2. MCP-BRIDGE receives the message and registers the camera in its device list.  
3. The LLM calls the `capture_image` tool (e.g., with `quality=mid, flash=false`).  
4. The bridge publishes a command to the appropriate MQTT `cmd` topic.  
5. The ESP32-CAM captures an image and publishes the result to the `events` topic.  
6. The bridge receives the event, matches it to the original request, and returns a response to the LLM that includes a `proxy_url` for the captured image.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Dynamic Tool Discovery: Automatically expose device tools to the LLM based on announce messages.  
- [ ] Persistence: Save device and event history to a database.  
- [ ] Security: Implement robust authentication and ACL for MQTT and MCP.  
- [ ] Dashboard: A web UI for monitoring, orchestration, and workflow management.

## Relation to Project Saba

MCP-BRIDGE is a core component of Project Saba's Core Server, acting as the primary gateway that connects LLMs to physical sensors and actuators.
